# WeatherApp
Take home project

This project is a weather app that uses a geocoded endpoint to fetches locations and fetches its associated weather with another API call. The app also caches the selected locations. I decided not to cache the weather since we‚Äôll prob want the most up-to-date weather.

# ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why MVVM+C?
MVVM is battle tested architecture that has clear separation of data from API -> UI and suits this project.

#### [Networking] -> [Model] -> [ViewModel] -> [View]


# üßê Is that a +C in MVVM+C?
So maybe it‚Äôs more like:

#### [Coordinator] -> [Networking] -> [Model] -> [ViewModel] -> [View]

My appreciation for the Coordinator pattern came when implementing deep linking in my previous role. The Coordinator typically handles Networking and Navigation and can be spun up in an instant, making the app more modular. With a bit of dependency injections, the app and its components become far more testable.


# üî•SwiftUI?
Aside from the fact that,

SwiftUI is great for rapid development. Plus, SwiftUI/Combine is the future!... in my opinion. It‚Äôs highly unlikely UIKit will be dethroned any time soon. So‚Ä¶ I attempted to answer the question as to how these two frameworks could work with one another in a realistic way.

I can also appreciate a codebase that is soft on newer, native API and frameworks (in good time of course). Be the change you wish to see, right?


# üë¥üèæ If I had more time‚Ä¶
- If this was an enterprise app, I would move the Networking from the ViewModel to the Coordinator, mainly for consistency with UIKit implementation.
- Add more tests
- Added more subtle animation w/ SwiftUI (cause why not?!)
- Added more dummy data. The free version of this API doesn‚Äôt give us a ton.



# ‚öñÔ∏èTrade offs
Its not super obvious, but because we‚Äôve decided to run with UIKit as a base and layer SwiftUI over the top, all of our navigation is done in the UIKit world. Meaning we lose the ease of SwiftUI navigation (NavigationView/NavigationLink). You‚Äôll probably notice some of the workarounds implemented dealing with the Nav titles within the Weather Search Coordinator

\* I really hope Apple comes out with more APIs to help SwiftUI interface with UIKit.


# üòå Stuff I‚Äôm proud of
- Architecture: You might notice my attempts to consider a Combine solution for data transportation (check out [WeatherSearchCoordinator.swift](https://github.com/Cwalker924/WeatherApp/blob/main/WeatherApp/Coordinators/WeatherSearchCoordinator.swift)) over other more traditional approaches (delegates, KVO, etc).
- Custom image caching that ultimately resulted in cloning the native AsyncImage APIs implementation
- Subtle animations so changes are less jolting


# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run
Once you‚Äôve entered a development team for the project, and have entered your api key in ([APIKeys.swift](https://github.com/Cwalker924/WeatherApp/blob/main/WeatherApp/Networking/APIKeys.swift)) press XCode‚Äôs play button!


# ‚ôªÔ∏è Reused code
The Coordinator class is re-used code from previous projects.
